Current replacement costs, where available, range from $280 to $335 per pair (one CW, one CCW). Sourcing a full set of replacements may be challenging and expensive.</p> </li> <li> <p>Recommendation: Replace all damaged propellers immediately. Given the difficulty in sourcing exact replacements, investigate suitable alternative propeller options compatible with the Nakoda motors and frame if a full set cannot be acquired.
