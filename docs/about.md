These are the documentation pages for the sUAS rebuild of Arizona Game and Fish Department (AZGFD) heavy lift sUAS "Nakoda" by [Institute for Computation & Data-enabled Insight (ICDI)](https://datainsight.arizona.edu){target=_blank} and [Data Science Institute (DSI)](https://datascience.arizona.edu){target=_blank} staff at The University of Arizona.

## Background

In 2019 AZGFD commissioned Arizona State University to develop a heavy lift sUAS (<20kg) that could deliver medicated food pellets to Gunnison's Prairie dogs in and around [Black-footed Ferret Recovery](https://www.azgfd.com/2024/11/21/bringing-endangered-black-footed-ferrets-back-to-aubrey-valley/){target=_blank}.

The sUAS crashed several times, both during development and its early operational flights. After its last crash it was later shelved and has been in storage for ~5 years. 

## Equipment 

In January 2025 the Nakoda sUAS, its "mini-me" test sUAS, and all of its support equipment were delivered to me at University of Arizona.

AZGFD dropped off the drone with all of its associated support equipment and storage boxes. See [Equipment](equipment.md) for the list of items. 

## Repair 

In spring of 2025 we began to dissasemble the Nakoda UAS to inspect it and to clean its associated parts. 

The first goal is to determine whether Nakoda (1) should be broken down for salvage, or (2) can be repaired for minimal cost and flown again. 

See [Repair Pages](repair.md) for details on the repair.

## Documentation

Nakoda did not arrive with any set of instructions for how to operate it, how to use or program the remote controls, how to charge or maintain the batteries, or how to use a Ground Control Station (GCS) with autonomous mission planning software. 

I am creating and curating these documentation pages for posterity, and for AZGFD staff who will operate and maintain it.
