## What is Remote ID?

Remote ID is the FAA's required signal broadcasting for all drones weighing more than 255 grams. 

Remote ID is required as of March 2024.

All drones, including DIY drones, must use Remote ID while in operation.

## Ruko ID

I purchased a [Ruko Remote ID module](https://www.ruko.net/products/ruko-r111-remote-id-module) from Amazon. 

the Ruko has a separate USB-C charger, and runs wirelessly on either Nakoda or Mini-me. It can be managed using a [Cell Phone App](https://rukotoy.com/download-center/products/r111) 

Note: this is a Chinese made device, but is [compliant with US regulations](https://www.ruko.net/blogs/ruko/drone-regulations-in-the-usa).
