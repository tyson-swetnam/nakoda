## Cleaning

Dust is the enemy of electric motors and electronics.

All parts were wiped with a microfiber cloth. Electronics and motors were blasted with compressed air and wiped with Q-tips. 

## Inspection

### Carbon Body

The Carbon body of Nakoda is intact, but I am leary about its design and load bearing strength.

Further, the battery is currently housed above the Pixhawk and PDB. This higher center of gravity may be affecting the flight behavior of the octocopter.

### Carbon Arms

Nakoda is designed to lift heavy weight at its centroid, while all of its thrust is coming from the ends of its arms. This tension results in the arms bending upward and the Hopper swinging like a pendulum beneath it.

### Metal brackets

There are metal brackets which hold the landing gear and antenna

### Wires and soldering points

The soldering of the PDB on Mini-me was concerning, some of the hot and ground wires were nearly soldered together (or were in fact touching). There was melted plastic as well, suggesting arcing had occured.

### Power Distribution Board

The PDB was replaced on Mini-me.

### ESCs

Wiring for the ESCs was incomplete. 

### Motors

The motors were inspected. 

The wiring for the Motors to the PDB for Ardupilot is:

### Propellers

I inspected all of the Nakoda 30" propellers. 

There are both left handed (counter-clockwise) and right handed (clockwise) propellers.

Several of the propellers are damaged. Most have minor damage, which may cause vibration and drag. Several have major damage, and one is broken. I used a paint marker to indicate which props are failing or should not be used.
