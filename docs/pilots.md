# Obtaining FAA Part 107 Remote Pilot Certificate

Operating drones safely and legally requires understanding and complying with both federal and state regulations. Obtaining your Part 107 certificate is the crucial first step for any non-recreational operation.

This guide provides information on obtaining the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Remote Pilot Certificate required for non-recreational drone operations (often called flying under "Part 107") and outlines key federal and Arizona-specific drone regulations.

**Disclaimer:** Regulations can change. Always consult official FAA and Arizona state sources for the most current information. This guide is for informational purposes only and does not constitute legal advice.

## Part 1: What is a Part 107 Certificate and Who Needs It?

The FAA's **Remote Pilot Certificate** allows individuals to operate Small Unmanned Aircraft Systems (sUAS, or drones) for **non-recreational purposes**. This includes:

* Commercial activities (photography, videography, mapping, inspections)
* Government operations (research, public safety support - unless operating as a public aircraft)
* Educational uses
* Any flight that is not *strictly* for personal fun or enjoyment.

If you only fly drones weighing less than 55 lbs for *purely recreational purposes*, you do *not* need a Part 107 certificate. However, recreational flyers **must** pass **The Recreational UAS Safety Test (TRUST)**, register drones over 0.55 lbs (250g), and follow specific recreational flying rules.

**This guide focuses on obtaining the Part 107 Certificate for non-recreational operations.**

## Part 2: Obtaining Your FAA Part 107 Remote Pilot Certificate

Here are the steps to become an FAA-certificated Remote Pilot:

### Step 1: Meet Eligibility Requirements

You must:

* Be at least 16 years old.
* Be able to read, speak, write, and understand English.
* Be in a physical and mental condition to safely operate a drone.

### Step 2: Study for the Aeronautical Knowledge Test

You need to pass the FAA's "Unmanned Aircraft General - Small (UAG)" knowledge test. Key topics include:

* Applicable regulations (14 CFR Part 107)
* National Airspace System (NAS), including reading sectional charts
* Flight restrictions and airspace classifications
* Aviation weather sources and effects (micrometeorology)
* Drone loading and performance
* Emergency procedures
* Crew Resource Management (CRM)
* Radio communication procedures
* Determining drone performance
* Physiological effects of drugs and alcohol
* Aeronautical Decision-Making (ADM)
* Airport operations
* Night operation requirements

**Study Resources:**

* FAA's suggested study materials (available online)
* Paid online courses (e.g., UAV Coach, Pilot Institute, etc. - many offer pass guarantees)
* Free online resources and practice tests

*(Expect to spend 15-25 hours studying, depending on prior knowledge.)*

### Step 3: Obtain an FAA Tracking Number (FTN)

* Register for an account on the FAA's **Integrated Airman Certification and Rating Application (IACRA)** website.
* This will assign you a unique FTN, which you'll need to schedule your knowledge test.

### Step 4: Schedule and Take the Knowledge Test

* Locate an FAA-approved **Knowledge Testing Center** near you (often at flight schools or airports).
* Schedule your test appointment.
* The test fee is typically around **$175**, paid directly to the testing center.
* Bring a government-issued photo ID to the test.
* The test consists of 60 multiple-choice questions, and you need a score of **70% or higher** to pass.

### Step 5: Complete FAA Form 8710-13 via IACRA

* Once you pass the test (it may take 48 hours for results to appear in IACRA), log back into your IACRA account.
* Complete the electronic FAA Form 8710-13 (Application for Remote Pilot Certificate).
* Enter your 17-digit Knowledge Test Exam ID when prompted.
* Sign the application electronically and submit it.

### Step 6: TSA Security Background Check

* The FAA will submit your application information for a routine Transportation Security Administration (TSA) security background check. This happens automatically after you submit your application.

### Step 7: Receive Your Certificate

* After passing the background check, you will receive instructions via email to print a **temporary Remote Pilot Certificate** from IACRA (valid for 120 days).
* Your permanent plastic certificate card will be mailed to you within approximately 6-8 weeks.
* You **must** have your certificate (temporary or permanent) readily accessible whenever operating under Part 107 rules.

## Part 3: Maintaining Your Part 107 Certificate

* To keep your Part 107 certificate current, you must complete an **online recurrent training course** every **24 calendar months**.
* This training is **free** and available on the **FAASafety.gov** website.
    * Non-Part 61 pilots take course **ALC-677**.
    * Pilots current under Part 61 take course **ALC-515**.
* Passing the online quiz associated with the course renews your currency for another 24 months. Keep the completion certificate as proof.

## Part 4: Key FAA Part 107 Operating Rules (Summary)

Operating under Part 107 means adhering to specific rules, including:

* **Visual Line of Sight (VLOS):** You or a designated visual observer must be able to see the drone at all times without aids (other than corrective lenses).
* **Altitude Limit:** Generally fly below 400 feet Above Ground Level (AGL), unless flying within 400 feet of a structure.
* **Airspace Authorization:** You need FAA authorization (usually via LAANC or DroneZone) to fly in controlled airspace (Class B, C, D, and surface E). Class G (uncontrolled) airspace generally does not require authorization.
* **Daylight Operations:** Fly during daylight hours (official sunrise to sunset).
* **Night Operations:** Flights between civil twilight and sunrise require the drone to have operational anti-collision lighting visible for at least 3 statute miles. You must also have completed the relevant night operations training module in your initial or recurrent knowledge test/training.
* **Flight Over People/Moving Vehicles:** Prohibited unless your drone meets specific category requirements (Category 1, 2, 3, or 4) for such operations *and* you follow the associated operating rules, or you have a waiver.
* **Yield Right of Way:** Always give way to manned aircraft.
* **Speed Limit:** Maximum groundspeed of 100 mph (87 knots).
* **Weight Limit:** Drone must weigh less than 55 lbs (including payload) at takeoff.
* **Single Pilot Operation:** One remote pilot cannot operate more than one drone at a time.
* **No Careless/Reckless Operations:** Do not operate in a manner that endangers people or property.

*(Waivers can be requested from the FAA for certain operational restrictions.)*

## Part 5: FAA Drone Registration

* **Requirement:** Drones weighing **0.55 lbs (250 grams) or more** up to 55 lbs must be registered with the FAA.
* **Registration Portal:** Use the **FAA DroneZone** website.
* **Part 107 vs. Recreational:**
    * Drones operated *exclusively* under Part 107 must be registered individually under Part 107 rules ($5 fee per drone, valid for 3 years).
    * Drones operated *exclusively* for recreational purposes can be registered under the "Exception for Limited Recreational Operations" ($5 fee covers all recreational drones owned by the individual for 3 years).
    * A drone registered under one rule cannot be flown under the other; if a drone is used for both, it **must** be registered under Part 107.
* **Marking:** The FAA registration number must be clearly marked on the exterior surface of the drone.

## Part 6: FAA Remote ID Requirements

* **Requirement:** As of March 16, 2024, most drones requiring registration must broadcast **Remote ID** information (like a digital license plate).
* **Compliance Methods:**
    1.  **Standard Remote ID:** Operate a drone manufactured with built-in Remote ID capabilities (check the FAA's Declaration of Compliance list).
    2.  **Broadcast Module:** Attach a separate Remote ID broadcast module to a drone that doesn't have built-in capability. The module's serial number must be linked to the drone's registration in DroneZone.
    3.  **FAA-Recognized Identification Area (FRIA):** Operate without Remote ID equipment only within specific geographic areas approved by the FAA (primarily model aircraft flying fields).
* **Registration Update:** When registering or updating your drone information in DroneZone, you must indicate if it has Remote ID capabilities and provide the serial number (either the drone's standard RID S/N or the attached module's S/N).

## Part 7: Arizona State Drone Laws

Arizona has a specific state law (**ARS § 13-3729**) that governs drone operations and significantly **preempts** (limits) the ability of cities, towns, and counties to create their own drone rules.

* **State Preemption (ARS § 13-3729 C):** Local municipalities generally **cannot** enact ordinances regulating drone ownership or operation. This creates fairly uniform rules across the state, primarily governed by FAA regulations and state law.
    * *Exception:* Local governments *can* regulate the takeoff/landing of drones in parks/preserves they own, provided other parks are available for drone use, or if they only own one park. They can also regulate drones owned *by* the city/town/county itself.

* **State Prohibitions (ARS § 13-3729 A & B):** It is unlawful in Arizona to operate a drone if the operation:
    * Is prohibited by FAA regulations.
    * **Interferes with law enforcement, firefighter, or emergency services operations** (Class 1 Misdemeanor).
    * Intentionally photographs or loiters over or near a **"critical facility"** (e.g., power plants, refineries, water treatment plants, substations, hospitals, jails, military installations, etc.) in furtherance of a criminal offense (Class 6 Felony, subsequent offense Class 5 Felony).

* **Reckless Operation (ARS § 28-8280):** Operating any aircraft (including drones) carelessly or recklessly, endangering life or property, is a Class 1 Misdemeanor.

* **Arizona State Parks:** Current Arizona State Parks & Trails policy **prohibits recreational drone takeoff and landing** within state parks. Commercial use requires evaluation via a Filming Permit application, including proof of insurance and FAA registration/certification. Always check the specific park's rules before visiting.

* **Privacy:** While not explicitly detailed in the primary drone statute beyond critical facilities, general privacy laws apply. Avoid flying over private property in a way that could constitute trespassing or illegal surveillance.

## Part 9: Expert Assistance for Heavy Drone & Aerial Application Compliance

Operating drones weighing 55 lbs or more, or engaging in aerial application activities like crop spraying, involves significantly more complex FAA regulations than standard Part 107 operations. Navigating these requirements often demands specialized knowledge, extensive documentation, and direct interaction with the FAA.

For individuals or organizations needing to comply with these advanced regulations, specialized consulting services offer "done-for-you" or guided assistance. These services leverage expertise in aviation regulations and documentation to help clients achieve compliance efficiently.

Here's an overview of the key areas where these services can assist:

### FAA Section 44807 Heavy Drone Exemption (> 55 lbs)

* **What it is:** An exemption granted by the FAA allowing the operation of unmanned aircraft weighing 55 pounds or more for commercial or other non-recreational purposes. Standard Part 107 rules only cover drones *under* 55 lbs.
* **The Challenge:** Obtaining a 44807 exemption requires petitioning the FAA and demonstrating that the proposed operation can be conducted safely. This typically involves submitting a comprehensive safety case, detailed operational manuals (flight operations, maintenance, training), risk assessments, and potentially specific crew training and qualification standards. The process is rigorous and requires a deep understanding of aviation safety principles.
* **How Services Help:** Consultants can manage the entire petition process, including:
    * Developing the necessary operational, maintenance, and training manuals.
    * Conducting risk assessments and building a robust safety case.
    * Preparing and submitting the formal Petition for Exemption to the FAA docket.
    * Liaising with the FAA on behalf of the petitioner to answer questions and provide clarifications.

### FAA Part 137 Aerial Applicator Certification

* **What it is:** An operating certificate required by the FAA for dispensing substances from an aircraft, such as pesticides, fertilizers, or seeds (commonly known as agricultural aircraft operations or crop dusting/spraying). This applies even if the drone weighs less than 55 lbs, but is particularly relevant for larger agricultural drones often exceeding that weight.
* **The Challenge:** Part 137 certification involves meeting specific operational requirements, demonstrating knowledge of safe chemical handling and application (often requiring coordination with state agricultural departments), proving pilot competency, and potentially obtaining specific airworthiness approvals or exemptions for the drone used in spraying operations.
* **How Services Help:** Compliance services assist by:
    * Developing the required operational procedures and manuals specific to aerial application.
    * Guiding applicants through the knowledge and skill requirements.
    * Assisting with the application process for the Part 137 certificate itself.
    * Ensuring integration with other necessary compliance, like a 44807 exemption if the drone is over 55 lbs.
    * Advising on state-specific agricultural licensing requirements (like those potentially needed in Arizona).

### FAA Heavy Drone Registration (> 55 lbs)

* **What it is:** The process for registering drones weighing 55 pounds or more with the FAA. Unlike lighter drones registered online via DroneZone, these heavy drones require a paper-based N-Number registration similar to manned aircraft.
* **The Challenge:** This process involves submitting specific FAA forms (like AC Form 8050-1 - Aircraft Registration Application), providing detailed proof of ownership, and potentially more extensive aircraft specifications than required for online registration. Errors or omissions can lead to significant delays.
* **How Services Help:** Consultants ensure accurate and complete submission by:
    * Assisting in correctly completing the required FAA registration forms.
    * Helping gather and organize necessary supporting documents (proof of ownership, aircraft details).
    * Submitting the registration package correctly to the FAA Aircraft Registry.

### Benefits of Using Compliance Services

* **Expertise:** Leverage deep knowledge of complex FAA regulations and processes.
* **Time Savings:** Outsource the time-intensive tasks of research, documentation, and application management.
* **Efficiency:** Streamline the process and potentially reduce delays caused by incorrect or incomplete submissions.
* **Focus:** Allow your team to focus on core business operations rather than regulatory hurdles.
* **Higher Success Rate:** Benefit from the experience of professionals who regularly navigate these FAA processes.

### Finding a Provider

Reputable drone compliance consulting services can be found through online searches (e.g., "FAA drone consultant," "Part 137 drone assistance," "44807 exemption help"), industry association directories, or referrals. When selecting a provider, inquire about their specific experience with 44807 exemptions, Part 137 certifications, and heavy drone registrations.

**Disclaimer:** While compliance services significantly improve the likelihood of success and streamline the process, they cannot guarantee FAA approval. The final decision rests with the FAA based on the safety case, adherence to regulations, and operational plans presented. These processes often take several months to complete.
