## Background

In 2019 AZGFD commissioned Arizona State University to develop a heavy lift sUAS (<20kg) that could deliver medicated food pellets to Gunnisan Prairie dogs in and around Blackfooted Ferret recovery areas.

The sUAS crashed several times, during development and its first operational flight. It was later shelved and has been in storage for ~5 years. 

In January the sUAS and all of its support equipment were delivered to me at University of Arizona.

My goal is to first assess the aircraft to determine whether it is (1) salvage or (2) can be repaired and flown again.

## Repair 

### Develop Documentation

We need to create basic documentation for the maintenence, battery protocol, storage, and flight operations of the sUAS.

A Laptop needs to be provisioned with the flight software. 

I will create a MkDocs Material website here, that will be accessable to the AZGFD team over the internet. 

#### Maintenence

The sUAS and all associated hardware needs to be cleaned and inspected for damage or deterioration. 

#### Battery Protocol

Lithium batteries degrade over time, the current set of batteries are over 5 years old, and may not have been stored properly or in environmentally stable space. 

#### Storage

The sUAS came in multiple rubber and plastic storage boxes, the boxes need to be cleaned

#### Flight Operations

##### Preflight

Batteries must be cared for and discharged before long storage

Batteries must be charged and prepared for pre-flight

Remote control must be charged
